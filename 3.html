    <div class="container">

        <p style="margin-top: 40px"><span style="float: left; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 45px; line-height: 40px; padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 8px; padding-left: 3px;">If</span> we collectively work together —food producers, retailers, consumers, governments and citizens — we can start combating these many issues.

        Food waste is a staggering problem across the world that’s only increasing. In America alone, we’ve increased our waste by nearly 50 percent compared to 40 years ago. These 14 facts highlight just some of the ways food waste impacts our everyday life and helps show us what we can do to start solving the problem.</p>
        
        <div  style="float: left; position: relative; width: 25vw;">
        <p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Fact 1:</span> One person is credited with reducing an entire country’s food waste by 25%. So it’s safe to say that your actions can really make a difference in solving this ongoing problem.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 700">Fact 2:</span>  Fruits and vegetables, seafood, bread, lentils, meat, and dairy are some of the most commonly tossed food in the world. Forty-six percent (46%) of foods wasted are typically root vegetables, like potatoes, beets, and carrots.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 700">Fact 3:</span>  A healthier diet can equate to a greater amount of food waste, largely due to fruits and vegetables which require a lot of water and go bad quickly. Properly storing and preparing produce is key.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 700">Fact 4:</span>  Food waste accounts for 8% of global emissions, making it a significant contributor to climate change.</p>
        </div>
        <img src="pic3.jpg" style="float: left; padding-left: 15px">
        <p><span style="font-weight: 700">Fact 5:</span> : Less than 3% of food waste is recycled, which means food waste takes up more than 20% of our landfills and incinerators.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 700">Fact 6:</span>  Grocery stores are severely lacking when it comes to handling food waste. Out of the 10 largest grocery chains, not a single store received an A rating. Walmart ranked the best for their sustainability efforts, and only one retailer reports their total volume of food waste.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 700">Fact 7:</span>  In 2016, France became the first country to ban food waste in stores. Only five states in the U.S. have legislated similar bans, and five cities have followed suit.</p>
        <div   style="float: left; position: relative; width: 25vw;">
        <p><span style="font-weight: 700">Fact 8:</span>  Food is often safe even after it “expires.” Expiration labels — like “sell by” and “best by” — are misleading and not standardized, leading many consumers to toss out perfectly good food too early.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 700">Fact 9:</span>  A recent study funded by the United States Department of Agriculture found that global preferences for a “western diet” — high intake of carbohydrates, sugar, sodium — are major contributors to environmental burdens like greenhouse gas emissions and land use.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 700">Fact 10:</span>: Shrink wrapping or plastic packaging our produce actually helps reduce food waste by increasing the shelf life. Be sure to recycle the plastic in the collection bins in front of your grocery store!</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 700">Fact 11:</span> Lack of awareness of basic nutrition adds to food waste among consumers. Many people believe it’s better to buy fresh food that often goes bad when in reality, frozen food products often retain more nutrients.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 700">Fact 12:</span> The amount of food wasted could feed every hungry person in the world — again, and again, and again, and again.</p>
        
        </div>
        <img src="pic4.png" style="float: left; padding-left: 20px; width: 32vw; margin-left: 15px"><p><span style="font-weight: 700">Fact 13:</span> Having a big refrigerator can impact your food waste. You’re more likely to forget about food you have, improperly store your food and buy more than you can eat before it goes bad.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 700">Fact 14:</span> Unrealistic beauty standards don’t just affect our body image. They also impact our food waste problem. Farmers, retailers and consumers will throw away food if its “ugly.”</p>
